This chapter defines the terminology and the scope of the Act.
Key Definitions:
Data Principal: The individual to whom the data belongs (the user).
Data Fiduciary: The entity (company or person) that decides why and how data is processed.

Exclusions: It does not apply to data processed for personal/domestic purposes or data made publicly available by the user themselves.1
Chapter II: Obligations of Data Fiduciary (Rules for Companies)
This chapter outlines the responsibilities of those collecting data.
Grounds for Processing: Data can only be processed for a lawful purpose with the user's consent or for certain legitimate uses (e.g., medical emergencies, government services, or compliance with court orders).1
Notice & Consent:
Companies must provide a notice detailing what data is collected and why.
Consent must be free, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Users have the right to withdraw consent at any time.1
General Obligations:
